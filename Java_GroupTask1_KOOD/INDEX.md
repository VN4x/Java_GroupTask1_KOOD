## 🎤 Presentation Quick Prep

**What to memorize:**

1. **ROT13:** "Each letter shifts forward 13 positions"
   - Example: A→N, H→U
   - Property: Apply twice = original

2. **Atbash:** "Alphabet is mirrored or reversed"
   - Example: A↔Z, H↔S
   - Property: Apply twice = original

3. **Code Structure:**
   - main() = controls everything
   - rot13() = transforms with ROT13
   - atbash() = transforms with Atbash

4. **Program Flow:**
   - Loop asks user for input
   - Choose operation (encrypt/decrypt)
   - Choose cipher
   - Enter message
   - See result
   - Loop continues

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know you're ready when you can:

- ✅ Explain ROT13 in one sentence
- ✅ Explain Atbash in one sentence
- ✅ Compile and run the program
- ✅ Trace through one transformation
- ✅ Explain the main() method
- ✅ Run the program successfully
- ✅ Handle an error gracefully

- Have examples ready

### Tip 3: Understand, don't memorize
- Understand what each part does
- Be ready to answer "Why?"
- Know the algorithms, not just the code

### Tip 4: Practice your explanation
- Explain ROT13 to a friend
- Explain Atbash to a friend
- Get feedback
- Adjust your explanation

### Tip 5: Know your backup
- Have examples written down
- Know what "shift by 13" means
